    description: "Step-by-step instructions on applying for an Intervention Order in Victoria.",
    content: `<p>If you or someone you care about needs protection from family violence, stalking, or other harmful behaviour, you can apply for an Intervention Order (IVO) at the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria.</p>

  <h2>1. Decide which type of order to apply for</h2>
  <p>There are two main types of intervention orders in Victoria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Family Violence Intervention Order (FVIO)</strong> – protects a person from a family member who is violent or threatening.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Safety Intervention Order (PSIO)</strong> – protects a person from someone who is not a family member (for example, a neighbour, co-worker, or acquaintance).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Gather key information</h2>
  <p>Before applying, collect details such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your contact details and safe address (if different from your home).</li>
    <li>Information about the person you want protection from (the ‘respondent’).</li>
    <li>Dates or examples of incidents, threats, or concerning behaviour.</li>
    <li>Any existing court orders or police involvement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Choose how to apply</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Online (FVIOs only):</strong> Apply for a Family Violence Intervention Order online using the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria portal. Complete and submit your application from home or with a support service.
      <br><a href="https://fvio.mcv.vic.gov.au/" target="_blank">Apply online for an FVIO</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In person or by email (PSIOs):</strong> Applications must be made at your nearest Magistrates’ Court or submitted by email. There is no online option for PSIOs.

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Fill out the application form</h2>
  <p>Provide details of what happened and why you need protection. Be as specific as possible about any threats, violence, or stalking.</p>

  <h2>5. Submit your application</h2>
  <p>After submitting, a <strong>court registrar will contact you</strong> to confirm receipt and explain the next steps. This may include an appointment to review your application or discuss additional information.</p>
  <p>The court may grant an <strong>interim order</strong> (temporary protection) until your first court date. You can request an interim order in your application or ask the registrar when they contact you.</p>

  <h2>6. Attend your court hearing</h2>
  <p>You’ll be given a date to attend court. This is when the magistrate considers your application. You can have support people or a lawyer with you.</p>
  <p>If you feel unsafe seeing the respondent, let the court registry know in advance so they can arrange a safe waiting area.</p>

  <h2>7. After the order is made</h2>
  <p>If an order is granted, make sure you understand it and keep a copy. If the respondent breaches the order, contact the police immediately.</p>

    title: "How will I be supported in court?",
    slug: "court-support",
    description: "Overview of support available in court.",
    content: `<p>Going to court for an Intervention Order (IVO) can feel overwhelming, but there are several support options available to help you through the process.</p>

  <h2>Court Network Volunteers</h2>
  <p>Trained volunteers from the Court Network are available at most Magistrates’ Courts. They can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Explain court procedures in plain language.</li>
    <li>Provide emotional support before, during, and after your hearing.</li>
    <li>Help you understand any documents or orders.</li>
    <li>Assist with practical matters, such as locating safe waiting areas.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can contact the Court Network over the phone for support or to arrange in-court assistance on <a href="tel:1800571239"><strong>1800 571 239</strong></a>.</p>

  <h2>Duty Lawyers</h2>
  <p>Duty lawyers are available at many Magistrates’ Courts to provide free legal advice or representation for eligible clients. They can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Explain your legal rights and options.</li>
    <li>Help prepare your evidence and submissions.</li>
    <li>Provide advice or represent you in court if appropriate.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even if you are not formally eligible for full representation, it is still recommended to speak with a duty lawyer. They may be able to provide guidance or information relevant to your matter.</p>
  <p>To check your eligibility for a duty lawyer or obtain advice on accessing legal support, phone VLA on <a href="tel:1300792387"><strong>1300 792 387</strong></a> or ask court staff at the registry in advance or when you arrive.</p>

  <h2>Police‑initiated IVO applications</h2>
  <p>In some cases, police may apply for an IVO on your behalf, for example if you requested their assistance or if they believe there is a risk to your safety. When police make the application, the police will present the case in court and represent the application.</p>
  <p>It’s important to note that police only make the application in these circumstances; if you lodge the application yourself, the case is your responsibility and police do not automatically represent you.</p>

  <h2>Other Support People</h2>
  <p>You are allowed to bring a support person to court, such as a family member, friend, or any other community support. They can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide moral support and reassurance.</li>
    <li>Help you feel safer while waiting for your hearing.</li>
    <li>Assist you in understanding what is happening during the process.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Remember, you are not alone — support services, including duty lawyers, Court Network volunteers, police (if they are the applicant), and your chosen support people are available to help you feel supported and prepared during your court appearance.</p>`

    <li>Remove hats and sunglasses before entering.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Inside the courtroom</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bow slightly towards the bench (the Coat of Arms) when entering or leaving the courtroom — this shows respect for the court, even if the magistrate is not yet present.</li>

    <li>Address the magistrate as “Your Honour.”</li>
    <li>Stay calm, avoid interrupting, and speak respectfully.</li>
    <li>Do not gesture, sigh, or react visibly to what others say.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When speaking</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wait until the magistrate asks you to speak.</li>
    <li>Speak clearly, stick to the facts, and keep it concise.</li>
    <li>If you need to show a document, explain it and hand it to court staff — never approach the bench uninvited.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Around the court</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No eating, drinking, chewing gum, or recording.</li>
    <li>Avoid bringing children unless absolutely necessary.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Safety and support</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Let the court registry know in advance if you do not want to see the other party — they can arrange a safe waiting area.</li>
    <li>Court Network volunteers are often available — you can request assistance at the registry.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Overall, be respectful, stay calm, and focus on the facts. Good courtroom etiquette can make the process smoother and show the magistrate that you are taking the matter seriously.</p>`
